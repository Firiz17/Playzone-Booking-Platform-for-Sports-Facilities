## Challenges

1. When our website crashes at certain times, weâ€™ve realized that we need to be more cautious. Moving forward, weâ€™ll take note not to easily commit and sync our changes to the web.php file without proper consideration, as it can affect our group members' work.
2. Communication is important, i realize that too late as I tried to do my work on my own, and did not try to reach out to my teammates earlier
